   <p>Over the Summers, I visited Vietnam and Tokyo. Here are some pictures:</p>
   <h1>Saigon</h1>

<p>This is a photo of the view at the top of my hotel overlooking the view of Saigon, Vietnam. Depicted is one of the largest skyscrapers in Vietnam called the "Th√°p Bitexco Financial Tower." The building consists of apartments, workplaces, and also has a helipad one the top floors!</p>
   <h3>Why is this city so popular?</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Rich history</li>
     <li>Historical destinations and architecture</li>
     <li>Cultural foods</li>
     <li>District 1 financial hub</li>
   </ul>
      
   <h1>Tokyo</h1>

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/43T56WO.jpeg" alt="Shibuya Crossing" width="300"/>

   <p>This is a photo of Shibuya Crossing, a popular tourist attraction for first-time travelers to Japan. Here are some other places that I want to go to:
