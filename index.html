   <h3>Over the Summers, I travelled to many countries in Asia including Saigon, Vietnam and Tokyo, Japan. Here are some pictures and insight on these two cities:</h3>
   <h1>Saigon:</h1>

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HHpSUAg.jpeg" alt="View of Saigon" width="300"/>

   <p>This is a photo of the view at the top of my hotel overlooking the view of Saigon, Vietnam. Depicted is one of the largest skyscrapers in Vietnam called the "Th√°p Bitexco Financial Tower." The building consists of apartments, workplaces, and also has a helipad on the top floors!</p>

   <h3>Why is this city so popular?</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Rich history</li>
     <li>Historical destinations and architecture</li>
     <li>Cultural foods</li>
     <li>District 1: financial hub</li>
   </ul>
      
   <h1>Tokyo:</h1>

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/43T56WO.jpeg" alt="Shibuya Crossing" width="300"/>

   <p>This is a photo of Shibuya Crossing, a popular tourist attraction for first-time travelers to Japan. It is one of the busiest crossings in all of Japan, fulled with bright and lively buildings. Shibuya Crossing is most similar to New York's Times Square.</p>

   <h3>What's great about the city:</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Easy transportation (subways, trains)</li>
     <li>Very clean and self-disciplined</li>
     <li>Cultural foods</li>
     <li>Historical attractions such as the Meiji Shrine and Tokyo Skytree</li>
   </ul>


   
   <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Because there is a language barrier for me in Japan, I prefer to travel to Vietnam. In addition, I can speak Vietnamese, which helps me communicate with the locals there. Here are some other places that I want to go to in the future:
