   <h2>Over the Summers, I visited Vietnam and Tokyo. Here are some pictures:</h2>
   <h1>Saigon</h1>

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HHpSUAg.jpeg" alt="View of Saigon" width="300"/>

   <p>This is a photo of the view at the top of my hotel overlooking the view of Saigon, Vietnam. Depicted is one of the largest skyscrapers in Vietnam called the "Th√°p Bitexco Financial Tower." The building consists of apartments, workplaces, and also has a helipad on the top floors!</p>

   <h3>Why is this city so popular?</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Rich history</li>
     <li>Historical destinations and architecture</li>
     <li>Cultural foods</li>
     <li>District 1: financial hub</li>
   </ul>
      
   <h1>Tokyo</h1>

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/43T56WO.jpeg" alt="Shibuya Crossing" width="300"/>

   <p>This is a photo of Shibuya Crossing, a popular tourist attraction for first-time travelers to Japan. It is one of the busiest crossings in all of Japan and is most similar to New York's Times Square.</p>
   
   <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Because there is a language barrier in Japan, I prefer to travel to Vietnam. In addition, I can speak Vietnamese, which helps me communicate with the locals there. Here are some other places that I want to go to in the future:
